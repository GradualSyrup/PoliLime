					PoliLime is a consolidated news site created so that users do not need to visit multiple websites to
					gather information about a politician. A core feature of PoliLime is that it focuses more on a
					politician&#39;s
					work, initiatives, voting history, public statements, rather than paid for adverts or flashy
					headlines. Since
					the vast majority of PoliLime&#39;s users are going to be voters who want unbiased news about a
					politician,
					we limit the amount of news that is received from social media and rely more on news from low bias
					news sources; however, we do include Tweets and other social media posts that politicians post since
					many people use a politician&#39;s social media platform to solidify their opinion on them.
